This project aims at better undestanding education in Brazil with help from the ENEM data. The data currently used comes from the ENEM 2018 and you can download it from [INEP's website](http://inep.gov.br/microdados). 

The data is processed by the notebook on `processing/notebook.ipynb`. I also study there the impact from family income on student performance, but I realised I should have commented better on that for people to read and understand. I will do that as soon as I have some free time. 

Please check the main results of this project on [GitHub Pages](https://vinicius-cleves.github.io/enem/visualization/). There you can visualize the distribuition of student performance by subject, type of school, region and income.
